# VHDL Logic Gates Simulator

A digital logic project that simulates basic logic gates using pure VHDL. Designed for educational use and HDL skill demonstration.

## Features

- **AND, OR, NOT, XOR Implementations**
- **Readable Architecture and Entity Blocks**

## Technologies Used

- VHDL
- Any standard HDL simulator (e.g., ModelSim, GHDL)

## Key Achievements

- Demonstrates understanding of digital design fundamentals
- Clear entity/architecture separation
